                            <p class="card-text">Right now, the world is in the need of rapid vaccination drives which
                                will allow for herd immunity, which is the quickest way to come out of Covid-19 pandemic
                                and return to normalcy.
                            <p class="card-text">Due to personal prejudices, local politics or orthodox beliefs, we have
                                a considerable amount of population who are against vaccination drives. With the rise of
                                social media, the dissemination of information (hence, potentially, misinformation) has
                                become easier than ever before. Unsurprisingly, anti-vaccine activists have also began
                                to utilize platforms like Twitter to share their views. As a result, their activism has
                                expanded jurisdictions to include online propaganda. </p>
                            <p class="card-text">The results from this project will help CDC focus on what areas to
                                primarily focus on, to improve vaccination awareness. </p>

                            <p class="card-text">This project tends to determine the anti vaccine tweets related to
                                covid-19 by collecting tweets from the twitter API and performing various algorithms to
                                filter out the anti vaccine tweets . Using the location of these tweets’ source, the
                                locations were plotted on the world map.


                            </p>

                            <h2 class="card-title h4">Data and Approach</h2>
                            <p class="card-text">The dataset consists of Covid 19 vaccination tweets. The data collected
                                from the twitter stream captures all languages, but the higher prevalence are English,
                                Spanish, and French. The Structure of the data is: user’s tweet_id, date, timestamp,
                                language of the tweet and the country code. These attributes can be used to mine the
                                tweets, to find out the various regions where people have tweeted in favor or against
                                the vaccines.
                            <p class="card-text">Based on the geographical location-based information extracted after
                                clustering the anti vaccine related tweets, the government/ CDC can focus on educating
                                the populace about benefits of covid 19 vaccine in those areas. </p>

                                <li>The twitter IDs available for Covid tweets were hydrated to get the actual data.

                                <li>Data cleaning was done in the following steps

                                <li>The tweets were converted to sentence embedding Ks using an existing model.

                                <li>Using cosine similarity between the K points and tweets with the sentence
                                    embeddings, the tweets were clustered into the three clusters (anti-vaxxer, neutral

                                <li>The algorithm was run to 10 epochs as the dataset was too large and took lots of
                                    time. </li>
                                <li>Unfortunately kmeans resulted in many false positives and did not result in any
                                    useful information. </li>
                                <li>So another attempt to use a different algorithm was made.</li>

                                to plot the resultant locations of anti-Vaxx tweets on the world map. For this
                                initially, from geopy.exc, GeocoderTimedOut was imported and from geopy.geocoders,
                                Nominatim was imported. Finally after removing the null or ambiguous columns, the
                                locations that were mentioned in the ‘location’ column were converted into their
                                respective latitude and longitude. Using these points, the locations were plotted on the
                                world map for the data received from both 1. Neural Networks and 2. Bag Of Words

                                But this algorithm gave lots of false positives

                                Bag of words algorithm used a predefined dictionary and hence only selected the tweets
                                that matched a specific words criteria. Hence the number of false positives was very
                                less and gave more accurate information about the locations. We can see that a lot of
                                central america is in the influence of anti-vaccination along with few states in the
                                east and south. Us is also predominant with anti-vaxx tweets and few in the coastal
                                regions of australia.

                                    vaccines not available, etc) rather than being about anti-vaxxers, even though
                                    initial points were chosen as that.

                                    oriented.</li>
                                <li>TThe Bag of Words used hand picked keywords, so it performed better. It had some

                                <li>As seen in the word cloud of the location of anti-vaxxer tweets, many major
                                    countries were found. States such as Texas, Arizona, Michigan, Georgia, NY,
                                    Louisiana are seen. The Eastern coast has more such tweets than the West Coast as
                                    seen in the map.
                                <li>Since these states have high populations, further analysis needs to be done based on
                                    which areas exactly are these tweets originating from. Since the tweets were
                                    selected only for English Language, the locations were found mostly from those
                                    countries that have a predominance of English users. Hence many countries with non
                                    English speakers couldn't be plotted as the tweets are in various languages Also a
                                    lot of data did not have anything mentioned in the location column or had ambiguous
                                    places like ‘home’, ‘planet earth’ etc. which put limitations on the exact places.
                                    But still a considerable amount of information and clusters have been obtained using
                                    the above algorithms and performing exploratory analysis.
                                    The application of this project is that the government can then look into the matter
                                    and help with the education and awareness that surrounds this cause.
