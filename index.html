                            <h2 class="card-title h4">Introduction</h2>
                            <p class="card-text">Right now, the world is in the need of rapid vaccination drives which
                                will allow for herd immunity, which is the quickest way to come out of Covid-19 pandemic
                                and return to normalcy.
                            <p class="card-text">Due to personal prejudices, local politics or orthodox beliefs, we have
                                a considerable amount of population who are against vaccination drives. With the rise of
                                social media, the dissemination of information (hence, potentially, misinformation) has
                                become easier than ever before. Unsurprisingly, anti-vaccine activists have also began
                                to utilize platforms like Twitter to share their views. As a result, their activism has
                                expanded jurisdictions to include online propaganda. </p>
                            <p class="card-text">The results from this project will help CDC focus on what areas to
                                primarily focus on, to improve vaccination awareness. This project tends to determine
                                the anti vaccine tweets related to covid-19 by collecting tweets from the twitter API
                                and performing various algorithms to filter out the anti vaccine tweets . Using the
                                location of these tweets’ source, the locations were plotted on the world map.</p>

                            <h2 class="card-title h4">Data and Approach</h2>
                            <p class="card-text">The dataset consists of Covid 19 vaccination tweets. The data collected
                                from the twitter stream captures all languages, but the higher prevalence are English,
                                Spanish, and French. The Structure of the data is: user’s tweet_id, date, timestamp,
                                language of the tweet and the country code. These attributes can be used to mine the
                                tweets, to find out the various regions where people have tweeted in favor or against
                                the vaccines.
                            <p class="card-text">Based on the geographical location-based information extracted after
                                clustering the anti vaccine related tweets, the government/ CDC can focus on educating
                                the populace about benefits of covid 19 vaccine in those areas. </p>
